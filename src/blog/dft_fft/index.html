		<p>This writing aims to be an introduction to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for those without any prior knowledge of regular Fourier series or transforms.</p>
		
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		
		<p>The motivation behind Fourier transforms is pretty simple: <i>you want to find out what sinusoidal components your signal has, and retrieve their respective amplitudes and frequencies</i>. This is indeed simple if you have already worked with such stuff, but it raises a lot of questions for a complete beginner. What is a signal? Why do I want to find its frequencies? Why do I use sines and cosines to accomplish this? How do I do this? To make everything clear, let's answer those questions. Or you can <a href="#skip">skip</a> this part.</p>
		
		<p><b>Signal</b>s are usually divided into four categories by two main characteristics. They can be discrete or continous in time (the domain) and similarly have discrete or continous values (the codomain). For now, making a distinction in the codomain serves no purpose, so we are left with two groups.</p>
		
		<p>In practice you have discrete signals, for example measurements with a timestamp and a numeric value. The <span class="plt_blue">blue dots</span> mark such a signal with five measurement points. These points can be easily represented programatically by an array with pairs of numbers as items.</p>
		
		<img id="signal" src="media/signal_lowfreq.png">
		
		<p><span class="mono">[(0.4, 1.17), (1.15, 2.74), (1.9, 2.84), (2.65, 1.42), (3.4, -0.77)]</span></p>
		
		<p>The <span class="plt_red">red line</span> represents a more abstract signal (3*sin(x) in this case). It is defined for every x, but dealing with concrete values gets harder as the functions composing the signal get more complex. At first glance it may seem, that the blue signal samples the red one, as it fits perfectly in those points, but <a onclick="hi_freq()">why would that be the case</a>? (<a onclick="lo_freq()">revert</a>)</p>
		
		<p>It seems abstract functions would serve a purpose in inter- and extrapolating values, if they would be unequivocally deducable. Without diving into the realm of interpolation we can say that there won't be a bijection between discrete and continous signals, but also that the <a onclick="lo_freq()">first signal</a> <i>clearly</i> fits our measurements more, where 'clearly' here remains an ambigous term for now.</p>
		
		<p>There are also two things worth mentioning about the <span class="plt_blue">blue signal:</span></p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The time scale is completely arbitrary. There is no real meaning behind t=0, so we can shift the whole signal left by 0.4. When we are dealing with only one signal, there is no reason not fix its start point at zero time as leaving the offset at 0.4 would only make our calculations more complicated.</li>
			<li>Samples are taken periodically at a fixed rate. That might <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_discrete_Fourier_transform">not always</a> be the case, but usually enough it is to use this simplification. As said above, the time scale is arbitary, so we can rescale the whole signal to have its samples taken at positive (and zero) integer time values. Of course you are probably dealing with physical quantities, so the time scale <i>is</i> important and should not be completely discarded, but more on that later.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>So, our signal looks like this now:</p>
		
		<img src="media/signal_norm.png">
		
		<p>Also the array form is trivialized even more, no need to store indices anymore:</p>
		
		<p><span class="mono">[1.17, 2.74, 2.84, 1.42, -0.77]</p></p>
		
		<p><b>Why do I use sines and cosines?</b> Firstly they are periodic functions. You might say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square wave</a> is periodic as well and way easier to make calculations with. But these signals are often pushed through integration and derivation steps, and it is rare to find such function that can survive these methods without minor alterations. Sine derives into cosine, and vica versa with a factor of -1, thus making repeated derivation return the original function after four steps. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function">Exponential</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function">hyperbolic</a> functions also have this property (and are closely related), but they are not periodic in the real domain. A flat constant zero function satisfies both properties, but is completely uninteresting.</p>
		
		<h2 id="skip">Synthesis and analysis</h2>
		
		<p>Our building blocks are cosine signals, which have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency">frequency</a> (f) and an amplitude (A) as paramteres (and a phase which we conviniently ignore for now).</p>
		
		{{ formula("simple_cosine.tex", 32) }}
		
		<p>The 2 * π * f part is often abbreviated as ω (greek small omega), but we'll stick with the 2πf notation.</p>
		
		<p>We can build more complex signals by summing some of these cosine signals (with different frequencies and amplitudes).</p>
		
		{{ formula("sum_cosine.tex", 20) }}
		
		<p>As the example shows, even the sum of three cosines can result in complex-looking functions:</p>
		
		<img src="media/sum_cosine_concrete.svg"> <!-- TODO solve multi colored TeX rendering -->
		
		<img src="media/synthesis_example.png">
		
		<p>Instead of preceiving this signal as a sum, we can treat that as an <b>inner product</b> of two vectors, one being the amplitudes, and the other the cosine terms.</p>
		
		{{ formula("synthesis_vectors.tex", 28) }}
		
		<p>What do we gain from that? Nothing, as long as we are plugging our <i>x</i>-es to this function one by one. But generally, if this signal is a generator, we are going to take more than one sample. With multiple <i>x</i>-es and frequencies the cos vector expands into a <b>matrix</b> and we have a matrix-vector multiplication.</p>
		
		{{ formula("synthesis_matrix.tex", 24) }} <!-- TODO extra space added at the right somewhy -->
		
		<p>Maybe it is more clear with a different notation:</p>
